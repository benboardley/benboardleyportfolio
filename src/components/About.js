        I will be finishing my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering at Purdue University in the spring of 2024. After this I will be pursuing a Masters of ECE to be complete in the Spring of 2025.

        My current academic focus converges on two major areas of interest: Software Engineering and Machine Learning.
        I am currently in search of an Internship for the summer of 2024 to help bridge the gap between my undergraduate and graduate studies in order to help me gain industry experience surrounding these two domains.
      <br></br><br></br>
        <h2 className = "font-bold">Current Activity</h2>
        <span> I am contributing to both IEEE ROV and the Purdue CAM2 Research group. Through these groups I have gained experience working on large and small teams with students ranging from Graduate to Freshman level.</span>
        <span>In IEEE ROV I have gained experience working on a large scale team. I have gained various experiences from camera streaming pipelines to embedded code to reproducability through Ansible.</span>
        <span>While in CAM2 I took on the project of developing the Infrastructure for a large scale computer vision competition. In which I had to create a submission evaluation pipline. This is detailed in the projects section.</span>
